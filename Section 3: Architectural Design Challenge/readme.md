## 1. Technical Specifications

### 1.1 Data Collection Layer

**Web Tracking Implementation:**
- **JavaScript Tracer Library**: Custom JavaScript SDK deployed on Wix comparison pages that captures:
  - Page views with session information
  - Chart interaction events (filtering, sorting, expanding features)
  - Affiliate link clicks with link ID, position, and context
  - User context (device type, location, referrer)


**Event Transportation:**
- **Apache Kafka**: Distributed streaming platform for reliable, high-throughput event ingestion
  - Multiple partitioned topics for different event types
  - Configured with appropriate retention policies
- **Schema Registry**:
- Maintains Avro schemas for all event types
  - Enforces backward compatibility for schema evolution
  - Provides clear documentation for data producers and consumers

### 1.2 Data Processing Layer

**Stream Processing:**
- **Apache Spark Streaming**: Real-time processing with 10-second micro-batches
  - Performs initial data validation and enrichment
  - Applies business rules for segmentation
  - Calculates real-time metrics for dashboards
- **User Segmentation Service**: 
  -Applies business-defined rules to categorize users
  - Integrates with existing user profile data
  - Maintains segmentation rules in a configurable service

**Real-time Storage:**
- **Redis/ElasticSearch**: 
  - For real-time analytics and dashboards
  - Maintains recent activity for immediate analysis
  - Optimized for quick lookups and aggregations

**Batch Processing:**
- **Scheduled ETL Processes**: Daily aggregations and transformations
  - Performs heavy transformations and complex joins
  - Creates aggregated views for reporting
  - Handles historical backfilling when needed

**Data Warehouse:**
- **Snowflake**: Cloud data warehouse for all processed event data
  - Separate databases for raw, transformed, and reporting data
  - Time-travel capabilities for debugging and auditing
  - Multi-cluster architecture for scaling compute and storage independently

### 1.3 Data Access Layer

**Data Quality:**
  - Validates data against expected patterns and thresholds
  - Generates data quality reports
  - Alerts on anomalies or drift in metrics

**Data Management:**
- **dbt (data build tool)**: Transforms raw data into analytics models
  - Maintains testing, documentationb for all transformations
  - Enables version control of transformation logic

**Data Catalog:**
- **Amundsen/DataHub**: Metadata management and data discovery
  - Indexes all data assets with descriptions and ownership
  - Enables search and discovery for analysts

**Data Marts:**
- Curated views specific to marketing needs
  - Attribution models
  - Campaign effectiveness
- **Self-Service**: Pre-aggregated tables for exploration

### 1.4 Analytics Layer

**Dashboards:**
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Shows current activity and immediate trends

**BI Tools:**
- **Looker/Tableau/PowerBI**: For business analysts to create custom reports
  - Self-service exploration of the data
  - Shareable dashboards and insights

**Self-Service Analytics:**
- **Custom interfaces** built on top of data marts
  - Simplified analysis tools for non-technical users

# 2. Implementation Considerations
## 2.1 Development Approach
**Phase 1: Foundation (4 weeks)**

- Set up core infrastructure (Kafka, basic pipelines)
- Implement initial JavaScript tracer with essential events
- Create basic data warehouse schema

**Phase 2: Enhancement (6 weeks)**

- Add advanced event tracking capabilities
- Implement stream processing for real-time analytics
- Build out comprehensive data models
- Develop advanced dashboards and reporting

**Phase 3: Optimization (4 weeks)**

- Refine data models based on initial feedback
- Implement data quality monitoring
- Add self-service capabilities

## 2.2 Testing Strategy
**Unit Testing:**

- Test individual components (trackers, processors, transformers)

**Load Testing:**

- Simulate high traffic scenarios (10x normal load)
- Verify system performance during peak periods

**Data Quality Testing:**

- Validate business rules and transformations
- Check for duplicates, missing values, and anomalies

## 2.3 Operational Considerations

- Custom Data Quality Monitoring:

- Alerts for unexpected drops in event volumes
- Notifications for schema validation failures
- Monitoring of data freshness in all layers

**Disaster Recovery:**

- Automated backups of critical configurations
- Documented recovery procedures

**Scalability:**

- Auto-scaling configurations for all components

## 2.4 Data Governance
**Access Controls:**

- Role-based access for different user types
- Column-level security for sensitive metrics
- Audit logging of all data access

# 3. Cost Optimization Recommendations
**Storage Tiering:**

- Hot data in performance-optimized storage
- Historical data in cost-optimized storage
- Archival data in cold storage with retrieval capabilities

**ETL Efficiency:**

- Optimize job scheduling to minimize compute costs
- Incremental processing where possible
- Implement partitioning strategies to limit data scans

**Monitoring and Analysis:**

- Regular review of resource utilization
- Identification of underutilized resources
